My review is solely based on T-Mobile as a whole and is an explanation of my particular circumstance. I purchased a t-mobile phone about 1 year ago. At the time I was living in the Buckhead area of Atlanta. About a week ago, I purchased a home about 15 minutes from my previous location in the Kirkwood community of Atlanta. This area is very established and part of Atlanta at large. It is also about a mile from Decatur square. In other words, this isn't a rural area.Upon moving in, I noticed not having any signal whatsoever, with the exception of a few fleeting 2G instances. The phone had no data and no solid ability to make a call. I called T-Mobile to investigate. The first time I was told there was a \"trouble ticket\" currently being serviced in the area. They would get back to me after they heard the results of the repair. They did and asked me to go back to the house and see how much my service had improved.The service was the same.I called in again a couple of days later and was told a new service request would be initiated. I was to give them a few days and then call back on Friday. I complied and today is Friday. In the back of my mind I wondered why they wouldn't follow up with me.I spoke at length with a technician about the situation and after he reviewed his engineer \"notes\" he promptly said there is nothing that can be done. There were no planned upgrades for my area for the next 6 months at least and the engineers have confirmed my area has poor service. I was forwarded to \"terminations\". Once I reached this new department and told them my whole story again, they informed me I \"had two options\", the first being me finding someone to \"take on my contract for me\" or, if that was \"not an option\" I could pay the $200 cancellation fee for \"wanting to get out of my contract\". At no time during my experience with T-Mobile have I ever been spoken to so short and cold. I have enjoyed the service for the most part with little trouble(except being over-charged every month and having to call in to get credited). I of course take issue with the idea of paying the contract cancellation fee and was told that I could either \"write to t-mobile\" as they don't \"talk about cancellations over the phone \"anymore\" or I could just \"deal with it\" and pay the fee. In hopes for a remedy to this situation, my first step is to post here. If no remedy will be found, I will next offer my experience to shoppers entering the T-Mobile retail locations. If anything, you need to know what a company treats you like when things don't go perfectly for them...and I want you to know, this is how you'll be treated. Of course, I would be perfectly content to move on from this if they waive the bogus \"early term\" fee. It's your choice, T-Mobile, nickel and dime me for $200 or lose future customers.

Maybe I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk up my extreme annoyance partially to the actual phone. (MyTouch 4G if it matters..) However, this review is about customer service.I stopped 3 or 4 days ago, and also today. Both times, I walked in and there were only two employees on the floor - both helping other customers already. \u00a0I don't know if it's ME or if it's cell phone stores in general or just this place specifically.. but I felt a general lack of caring customer service.The first day, I walked in and they sort of half-assed addressed me as some other customer that came in earlier whom they thought I was. I had to tell them \"no, not me\" more than once. I just waited for a few minutes for someone to be available, and the store rep closest to me addressed another guy who was walking around, and said \"We'll be right with you, sir.\" \u00a0I'm not sure if that guy came in before or after me, honestly, but regardless, they didn't tell me I was next after him or what. So, I moved to the next desk to stand \"in line\" - really, I made my own line by standing right behind the people who were being helped at the time.The same guy helped me both days.. friendly enough but BOTH times he answered personal phone calls on his cell phone with one hand, WHILE trying to fix my phone with the other hand. Is this allowed because this is a phone store? Whether it is or not: Super unprofessional. You let that sh!t go to voice mail, come on!In addition, every question I asked seemed to fail. I asked for a case, \"We don't have cases for that phone.\"I asked for screen covers, \"We don't have any that fit your phone.\" No offer for a screen cover that I could trim, either. I asked for a mini SD card, and he steered me away from purchasing theirs, because he said it was more expensive at TMobile than other places. What about the iPhone that is supposed to finally be coming out on TMobile? \u00a0Nope.. he didn't want to tell me about something he had no idea when they were going to start carrying. \u00a0Besides, he said the iPhone is not even that much greater than other phones anymore.I appreciate the honesty, but it felt a little more like he didn't want to do his job and help me find this stuff.. he just wanted me to go somewhere else for each piece.Then TODAY, besides the personal phone call reprisal, a co worker came up to him to give him money for some donation thing, and he had a friend show up who stood behind me. Both of these things must have distracted him because while he was replacing my sim card (so I could use my old phone for a day until a replacement phone came) somehow he lost the credit card sized card that the sim card comes in. So he typed some stuff into the computer and retried, and retried.. and finally said, \"Okay, I'll finish this later.\" .....Which I assumed meant I was good to go, and what he was referring to would not affect me....I confirmed with him my temporary phone was ready to go, and that I would get the replacement the next day. I said thanks and left. \u00a0Since I hadn't used the old phone since earlier in the week, the battery was dead. I got in the car and plugged it in to charge it. When it was ready, I turned it on and made a call to my Mother. Instead, I was directed to TMobile. The phone was not turned on!!! He \"finished\" with me and sent me on my way with my temporary phone not activated. \u00a0PISSED.This experience over both days is best compared to me walking up to a \"friend\" who \"knows stuff\" about phones and asking him to figure out what's wrong with it. Then the friend removes the battery, puts it back in, restarts it.. and tells me not to waste my money on anything else.
